**ü¶èüß´ Saving the Northern White Rhino:**  In 2008 IUCN declared the northern white rhinoceros (NWR) extinct in the wild. On March 19, 2018 the last NWR male died, leaving only females of this species left, and sparking new debate about how reproductive technologies can be used to save it. The northern white rhino is a mega-vertebrate and landscape architect and considered a keystone species. The ecological consequences of its extinction is not fully appreciated and could be far reaching.
Starting in 2015 an approach to save the NWR using advanced assisted reproductive technologies (aART), now carried out by BioRescue, is being developed. New embryos are created from eggs harvested from the last two surviving female NWRs, Najin, 28 and her daughter Fatu, 18, and fertilized with frozen NWR sperm. The embryos will subsequently be carried to term in surrogate southern white rhinoceros females.
A second leg of the ART approach is producing oocytes and sperms from induced pluripotent stem cells (IPSCs) derived from fibroblasts of frozen tissue samples [^1].
So far, 51 embryos have been produced from BioRescue aART procedures comprising hormonal ovarian stimulation, ovum pick-up, in-vitro oocyte maturation and in-vitro fertilization üß™ [^2].

In September 2023, BioRescue and [Colossal Biosciences](./Colossal_Biosciences.md) (Colossal) revealed that Colossal will piece together the genetic history, including the natural variation, of northern white rhinos from DNA sequences of historic museum specimen. Lost genetic variation will be genetically engineered into cell lines used for producing northern white rhino embryos. Additionally Colossal will apply its spinoff, FormBio to, via a comparative study between northern and southern white rhino genomes, identify genetic variants that existed before the decline of the northern white rhino [^3]. <!--Ancestral reconstruction of lost variants not present in historical specimen?-->
