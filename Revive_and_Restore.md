## Aim: Incorporating biotechnologies into standard conservation practice.

## Projects
**üêé‚åõThe Przewalski's Horse Project:** The Przewalski's horse is the last truly wild horse, never to have been bred on. It diverged from other horses 500,000 years ago. Passing through a recent bottleneck of only 12 individuals, preserved in Zoo's it was close to extinction. Up until recently, all (2,000+) Przewalski's horses were descendants of those 12 individuals.
In 2018, Revive and Restore, the [San Diego Zoo Wildlife Alliance](./San%20Diego%20Zoo%20Wildlife%20Alliance.md), and ViaGen Pets and Equine entered into a collaboration to clone the world's first Przewalski's horse from a cell line, cryopreserved by the [San Diego Zoo Wildlife Alliance](./San%20Diego%20Zoo%20Wildlife%20Alliance.md) Frozen Zoo in the 1980s, resulting in a foal born August 6, 2020, carrying new genetic variation to infuse into the current population.
On February 17, 2023 a second cloned Przewalski's horse was born from the same cell line[^1].
The foals (Kurt and Ollie) were cloned through somatic cell nuclear transfer, whereby the nucleus of a somatic (body) cell is transferred into a denucleated egg cell (oocyte). The resulting embryos initially developed in vitro before being implanted into their respective surrogate mothers[^2].
<!--I wonder if using an egg cell of a different species has influenced the cloned offspring in a negative way. The plan is to breed on Kurt and Ollie in captivity, which should not be affected by potential maternal effects, or by influence from contact with humans for that matter-->
