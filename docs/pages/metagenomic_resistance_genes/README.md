<h1 align="center">Antimicrobial Resistance Genes in Pig Manure</h1>

This study examines environmental DNA (eDNA) from pig manure to map out and quantify antimicrobial resistance (AMR) genes. By using metagenome-assembled genomes (MAGs) and comparing eDNA sequences with known AMR gene databases, we reveal the types and abundances of bacteria and resistance genes in pig manure from three agricultural farms.

### HIGHLIGHTS
- **MAG Assembly**: We employ a pipeline for the assembly of MAGs from metagenomic data, to describe the genetic content and potential function of bacteria within the microbial communities. This includes their capability for antibiotic resistance.
- **Public Data and Open-Source Tools**: The project leverages publicly available datasets and utilizes open-source software, such as Snakemake, to manage workflows. This approach underscores the accessibility and power of current bioinformatics tools in conducting high-quality genomic research.
- **AMR Gene Profiling**: Through targeted mapping and analysis, we quantify the abundance of AMR genes, offering insights into the spread and prevalence of antimicrobial resistance in pig manure across different farms.
